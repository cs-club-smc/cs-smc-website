# ADR-002: Branching and Pull Request Guidelines

- Status: Proposed
- Date: [2025-01-31]
- Deciders: [Jake TyCyn Schmidt]

## Context and Problem Statement

As our computer club website grows, we need a clear and beginner-friendly workflow for creating branches and submitting pull requests. This will help new developers contribute confidently while maintaining code quality and organization.

## Decision Drivers

- Want to make it easy for new developers to contribute
- Need to keep our main branch stable
- Want to make code reviews efficient and helpful
- Need to prevent merge conflicts
- Want to maintain clear project history
- Need to make collaboration smoother
- Want to build good Git habits for future development work

## Considered Options

1. GitHub Flow (feature branches + main)
2. GitFlow (develop, feature, release branches)
3. Trunk-based development
4. Environment-based branching

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Modified GitHub Flow with descriptive branch names and protected main branch

## Branch Naming Convention

### Format: `<type>/<scope>/<short-description>`

#### Where:

- `<type>` matches our commit types:

  - `feature` (or `feat`): New features
  - `fix`: Bug fixes
  - `style`: Visual changes
  - `docs`: Documentation updates
  - `refactor`: Code improvements
  - `test`: Adding tests

- `<scope>` matches our website sections:

  - `events`
  - `projects`
  - `members`
  - `resources`
  - `layout`
  - `shared`
  - etc.

- `<short-description>`: Brief hyphenated description

### Branch Name Examples:

You can choose between two levels of branch name specificity depending on the scope of your work:

#### Specific Feature Branches

Use this format when working on a focused, single-purpose change:

```bash
feature/events/calendar-view          # Adding a specific calendar feature
fix/members/profile-upload            # Fixing profile image upload
style/ui/button-components            # Updating specific button styles
docs/adr/branching-guidelines         # Adding specific documentation
feature/projects/submission-form      # New project submission feature
```

#### General Section Branches

Use this format when making multiple related changes to a section:

```bash
feature/events                      # Multiple event-related changes
feature/members                     # Major members section updates
feature/navigation                  # Navigation system overhaul
style/ui                            # Global UI refresh
feature/projects                    # Projects section revamp
```

##### Guidelines for Choosing:

- Use specific branches when changes are isolated and focused
- Use general branches when making multiple related changes
- Always prefer specific branches unless you have a clear need for a general one
- Never mix unrelated changes regardless of branch naming style

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Starting New Work

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create your new branch
git checkout -b feature/events/add-calendar-view
```

### 2. Working on Your Branch

- Make small, focused commits
- Push regularly to backup your work:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/events/add-calendar-view
  ```

### 3. Creating a Pull Request

#### PR Title Format:

Use the same convention as commits:

```
feat(events): add calendar view for upcoming workshops
```

#### Minimal PR Example (Let's Make It Better!)

```
feat(events): add event card

Made a card component for events that shows the event title, date,
and description. Tested it and it works.

Related Issue: #456
```

##### Why This Could Be Better:

- Doesn't specify what was actually changed
- No mention of how it was tested
- No visual reference for reviewers
- Doesn't indicate if there are any potential issues
- Makes it harder for reviewers to give meaningful feedback

##### When Is a Minimal PR Acceptable?

A minimal PR like this can be acceptable for simple fixes or changes where:

- The change is trivial (e.g., fixing a typo, updating a config file).
- The context is already well-understood by the team (e.g., a follow-up to a recent discussion).
- The change has minimal impact on functionality or user experience.

However, even in these cases, itâ€™s good practice to include:

- A brief description of the change.
- A link to the related issue or discussion.
- A note about testing (if applicable).

For all other changes, aim to provide more context and detail to make the review process smoother and more productive.

#### Good PR Description Example:

```
## Changes Made
â€¢ Added new Calendar component for events page
â€¢ Implemented date filtering and sorting
â€¢ Added hover states for event previews

## Screenshots
[Add screenshots of the new calendar feature]

## Testing Done
â€¢ Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
â€¢ Verified mobile responsiveness
â€¢ Checked keyboard navigation works

## Checklist
- [x] Code follows our style guidelines
- [x] Added necessary tests
- [x] Updated documentation
- [x] Tested on mobile devices
- [x] No console errors

Related Issue: #456
```

#### Overachiever PR Description Example (AKA "Please Future Employer Hire Me"):

```
feat(shared): create reusable EventCard component

## Changes Made
- Built new EventCard component using shadcn/ui Card as base
- Added responsive image handling with fallback states
- Implemented hover animations for better interactivity
- Created three variants: compact, standard, and featured
- Added skeleton loading state for better UX
- Made sure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

## Insights & Future Thoughts
I noticed while building this that we might want to create a standard MediaCard
component in the future, since this EventCard shares a lot of patterns we might
want for ProjectCard and ResourceCard too. I structured the component with this
in mind, keeping the media handling separate from the event-specific logic.
Also, we might want to consider lazy loading for images if we end up showing
many cards at once on the events page.

## Screenshots
[Before/After screenshots of the component]

## Testing Done
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Checked mobile responsiveness
- Verified keyboard navigation
- Tested loading and error states

   - Use "We" instead of "You"

   Example:

   ```
   Instead of:
   "You wrote this function wrong"

   Write:
   "We could make this function more efficient by..."
   ```

## Common Questions

### "Help! My branch is out of date with main!"

```bash
# Update your main branch

git merge main

# Fix any conflicts and continue
```

### "I made commits to the wrong branch!"

Don't panic! Talk to a team member - we can help move your changes to the right place.

### "I need to update my PR after review!"
